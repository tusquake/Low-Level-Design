## 📚 What's Inside

### 🔥 SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** - One reason to change
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** - Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** - Substitutable inheritance
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** - Focused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** - Depend on abstractions

### 🎨 Design Patterns
- **Creational**: Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype
- **Structural**: Adapter, Decorator, Facade, Composite
- **Behavioral**: Strategy, Observer, Command, State

### 🏢 System Design Examples
- Parking Lot System
- Elevator System
- Library Management
- Chat Application
- Food Delivery Platform
